## App Summary

Crescendo is a fully responsive, full stack React app which gives musical artists the ability to create their own website. Fans of the artist can check out music videos, singles and albums, images, and upcoming shows. The app also enableds fans to subscribe to the artist's email list where they will be notified of upcoming shows, free downloads and more. I am expanding this application.

If you don't wish to create an account, and just play around, there are demo user credentials provided at the login page.

This app incorporates secure authentication and authorization practices.
